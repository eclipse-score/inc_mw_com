/// \brief Interface of a Message Passing Sender, which can be used to send Message in an uni-directional channel.
/// \details ISender foresees overloads for Send() for differently sized messages. The reason for this is, that some OS
///          might provide more efficient IPC mechanisms for very short messages. So OS/IPC specific implementations of
///          ISender shall use the best performing mechanism. Additionally, the messages (see BaseMessage) also contain
///          some meta-info besides the payload (f.i. PID of the sender, message type/id). Some OS IPC mechanisms
///          (hint: QNX messaging) provide a separate "channel" to transfer such meta-data, So instead of adding it to
///          the transferred message payload, implementations of ISender are encouraged to use such features as it might
///          keep the effective data to be transferred small, which helps performance.

    ///           IReceiver needs to assure a decoupling of a message sent by ISender and the processing of
    ///           the message by IReceiver. I.e. any implementation, which unblocks the ISender from its Send() call
    ///           only after the IReceiver has processed the message would be an invalid implementation as it violates
