/// \brief Test sequence done by the consumer process in all Partial Restart ITFs (1-6)
/// \details Depending on the test-parameter ConsumerParameters::create_and_run_proxy the implementation of this func
///          dispatches to two different internal functions, which implement two different sequences, which are the
///          Consumer sequences defined in README.md in case of ITF 1 and ITF 2.
///          The single entry-point to the consumer sequences can be re-used in all 6 ITFs:
///          ITF 1: ConsumerParameters::create_and_run_proxy = true
///          ITF 2: ConsumerParameters::create_and_run_proxy = false
///          ITF 3: ConsumerParameters::create_and_run_proxy = true
///          ITF 4: ConsumerParameters::create_and_run_proxy = false
///          ITF 5: ConsumerParameters::create_and_run_proxy = true
///          ITF 6: ConsumerParameters::create_and_run_proxy = true
///          For the consumer restart tests (ITF 5/6) the sequence of the consumer can be much simpler. I.e. already
///          after the consumer reached checkpoint (1) - received N samples from provider - the sequence is basically
///          over and the consumer either gets killed or notified to terminate. We are still re-using the same consumer
///          implementation with the additional steps implemented, but in ITF 5/6 these steps won't be executed.
/// \see README.md in this directory
/// \param check_point_control check-point-ctrl communication object to sync with the controller (get proceed triggers
///        from controller and send notifications to controller about reached check-point or error)
/// \param test_stop_token stop-token connected to the overall test connected to the signal-handler set up in main().
///        I.e. this stop-token gets a stop-request sent, when the test infrastructure kills the test.
/// \param argc handed over by the test/main() in case the test has been started with "-service_instance_manifest", so
///        that argc/argv can be used to initialize the lola/mw_com runtime with the cmdline.
/// \param argv see argc
/// \param test_params parameters for sequence execution.
